##About
Just messing around with jpeg glitching.

The main program is glitch.py. Also included is printImg.py, which will print out the bytes in an image. You probably don't want to use that on any reasonably-sized image.

##Usage

`glitch.py [image file]` or `glitch.py [image file] [number of iterations]

##Example
